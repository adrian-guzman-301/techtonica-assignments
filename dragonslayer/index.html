  <h1>dragonslayer</h1>
  <p>You are in the heat of battle against a dragon! And your stamina and health are extremely low. You can still manage to swing your weapon, but your battle fatigue and the dragon's agility means you can only successfully hit the dragon 50% with each swing</p>
  <p>If you hit the dragon 4 times after the 10th swing, you slay the dragon!</p>
  <p>If you <em>don't</em> hit the dragon 4 times after the 10th swing, the dragon will slay <em>you</em>!</p>
