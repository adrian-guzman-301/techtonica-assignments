  <h1>dragonslayer</h1>
  <p>You are a powerful knight in the heat of battle against a dragon!<br>You've been fighting for days but can still manage to swing your weapon.<br>Your battle fatigue and the dragon's agility means you can only successfully<br> hit the dragon 50% of the time with each swing.</p>
  <p>If you hit the dragon 4 times by 10th swing, you slay the dragon!</p>
  <p>If you <em>don't</em> hit the dragon 4 times by 10th swing, the dragon will slay <em>you</em>!</p>
