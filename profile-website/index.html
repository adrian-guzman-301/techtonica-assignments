  <section>
    <p>Before entering tech, I worked in politics where I was juggling logistics, data, and people all at once. My experiences taught me to stay adaptable and find creative solutions when things don't go as planned. I noticed how often the software-based tools we relied on would break down, and that really sparked my curiosity. It ultimately led me to Techtonica, where I build reliable, human-centered software.</p>
